### Welcome

This is my solution to one of my collage project, that i really liked

## Overview

### The task

The task was to implement an app that would be able to:

- fetch data from api
- show all of the stations
- on click each station should give us information about itself
- each information could be clicked and picked to show on the timeline from past week
- 3 graphs, temperature, humidity, and the third graph that contains all of the informations about your picked type of information (temperature, humidity, airpressure, windspeed, rainfall) from past week

### Deploy

You can check out my website right there --> [stationInformation](https://stationinformation.netlify.app/)

## Process

### Build with

- typeScript
- parcel
- module exports
- chart.js
- localStorage

### What I've learned

it was a good training about fetching data, functional programming, objects, arrays, libraries and business logic
that parcel will compile ts do js on its own
