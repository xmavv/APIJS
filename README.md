### Welcome

This is my solution to one of my collage project, that i really liked

## Overview

### The task

The task was to implement an app that would be able to:
- fetch data from api
- show all of the stationes
- on click each station should give us information about itself
- each information could be clicked and picked to show on the timeline
- informations shold not be longer than 1 week in the localStorage (that means we have chart with values from at most a week)
- 3 graphs, temperature, humidity, and the third graph that contains all of the informations about your picked type of information (temperature, humidity, airpressure, windspeed, rainfall) from past week
